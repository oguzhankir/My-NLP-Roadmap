- Co-occurrence Matrix, Co-occurrence Vector
- HashingVectorizer

### Pretrained Word Embedding
- Word2Vec (by Google) : (2 types) CBOW, Skip-Gram
- GloVe (by Stanford)
- fastText (by Facebook)

### Topic Modeling
- Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
- Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA)
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
- lda2Vec
- Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

### NLP with Deep Learning
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes)
- Embedding Layer
- Artificial Neural Network
- Deep Neural Network
- Convolution Neural Network
- RNN/LSTM/GRU
- Bi-RNN/Bi-LSTM/Bi-GRU
- Pretrained Language Models: ELMo, ULMFiT
